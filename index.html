        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I am an LSU student currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems and Decision Sciences.
          My dream is to one day become a Senior Web Developer and make beautiful web applications! 
          I love the idea of one day having a career in the tech industry. I will put 
          110% of my effort to satisfy the needs of customers!
        </p>
        <p>
          If I could describe myself as an animal, I would be a Turtle! They are slow and steady 
          which you need to be when you are programming! Sometimes you will have to spend hours trying 
          to find the solution to an error within your code and patience is the only thing 
          keeping you sane. Although turtles are slow, they can also be fast in water!
          I can be fast as well when completing tasks given to me with the utmost quality! I guess you can say 
          I can be very versatile!
